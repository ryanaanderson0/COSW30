        <h1>Hi, I'm Ryan Anderson!</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Ryan Anderson. I am a second year Web Developmen student at LBCC. I am an avid gamer (Overwatch, anything on the Switch), horror film buff, and all around foodie. I currently work as a kitchen manager for a wood fired pizza catering company, hoping to switch careers to Web Developemnt. </p>
    
        <p>Some other hobbies I have are:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Bread baking</li>
            <li>Tennis</li>
            <li>Violin</li>
            <li>Vintage Cars</li>
        </ul>
    
    <?php
        echo"<p>Two of the websites I most frequent are <a href='http://www.theawesomer.com'>TheAwesomer</a> and <a href='http://www.craigslist.com'> Craigslist</p>
        <p>I found this process to be quite tedious, actually! I got trapped in a git headache because I missed a step and the changes I made weren't being pushed to my github! I had to re-read the stepts to pushing a change a couple times slowly and once I did them in the correct order everything worked out well.</p>"
